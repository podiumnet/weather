This is the podium weather app.

## Installation
There is no easy way to install this software as it is, so we'll put the hard way down. The easy way should be coming fairly soon.
1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org). The app needs it in order to run.
2. Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Other.)
  **On windows**, this can be done by opening the `run` dialog and typing `cmd`. On **other systems**, just try to launch the `terminal` program.
3. In the command prompt or terminal, type "npm i podiumnet/weather". Make sure you have root/admin privileges in the terminal/command prompt.
4. Whenever you want to run the weather app, go to a command prompt/terminal and type `pweather`. (Or, on windows, type the same in the `run` dialog.)
